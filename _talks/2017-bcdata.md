As a co-organizer of the 2017 bcdata Data Science Workshop part of my duties included providing a presentation (a Jupyter notebook) in the first week of the workshop on least-squares, ridge, polynomial and kernel regression methods. Another duty involved moderating the [career panel discussion](http://workshop.bcdata.ca/2017/talk/career-panel/). Finally, the second week of the workshop involved group projects where we ultimately presented on data insights from vehicle time series messages, a project supported by moj.io.
