## Abstract
A method includes obtaining closed-loop data associated with operation of an industrial process controller, where the industrial process controller is configured to control at least part of an industrial process using at least one model. The method also includes generating at least one noise model associated with the industrial process controller using at least some of the closed-loop data. The method further includes filtering the closed-loop data based on the at least one noise model. In addition, the method includes generating one or more model parameters for the industrial process controller using the filtered closed-loop data.
