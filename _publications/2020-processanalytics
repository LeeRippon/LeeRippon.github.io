## Abstract
Stable smelter operation is critical for successful production of base metals from particulate ore.
This work studies the operation of an industrial direct current electric arc furnace that operates as a smelter
in a large-scale metallurgical process. Specifically, unexpected loss of the plasma arc is an important
unresolved problem with a significant impact on the production efficiency of the process. Moreover, given
that electric arc furnaces are highly energy intensive units, even minimal improvements to the overall
production efficiency represent meaningful reductions in the environmental footprint of the process over
the lifetime of operation. To reduce the overall environmental footprint a predictive inferential sensor is
proposed to identify high risk operating regimes. Once a high-risk situation is identified the alarm instructs
operators to take corrective actions to avoid the loss of arc. Large amounts of historical industrial process
data have been collected, pre-processed and leveraged in a cross-validated supervised learning framework
that trains the inferential sensor model. New data, previously unseen by the model, are drawn from the
historical database and used to test the ability of the model to generalize. This work showcases our
progress to date including the training, validation and testing of competing inferential sensor models and
their ability to predict arc loss on industrial data.
