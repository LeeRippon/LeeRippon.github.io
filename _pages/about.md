Hi, I'm Lee and this is my personal website. I am a PhD candidate in Vancouver, BC and I am studying in the Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering (ChBE) at the University of British Columbia (UBC) in the [Data Analytics and Intelligent Systems (DAIS) laboratory](https://dais.chbe.ubc.ca/). 


Research
========

My current research focus is centered on investigating machine learning (ML) algorithms for advanced process control (APC) and fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) in process systems applications. The industrial applications of interest during my PhD include a kraft pulping process and a large-scale metallurgical process (along with simulated settings such as the Tennessee Eastman (TE) process). During my MASc I was focused on profile estimation using compressive sensing and adaptive control for sheet and film processes (e.g., paper making). A notable characteristic of my research portfolio is that it involves significant collaboration with industry leaders and industrial operations. These collaborations greatly assist with positioning my research in a context that enables production of research with a real-world impact.


Advising
========

My primary research supervisor, [Prof. Bhushan Gopaluni](https://www.chbe.ubc.ca/profile/bhushan-gopaluni/) is the head of the DAIS laboratory, Associate Dean of Education and Professional Development in the Faculty of Applied Science and a Professor in the department of Chemical and Biological Engineering at UBC. My co-supervisor, [Prof. Philip Loewen](https://www.math.ubc.ca/~loew/) is the head of the Department of Mathematics at UBC. During my MASc at UBC I was also supervised and co-supervised by Prof. Gopaluni and Prof. Loewen, respectively.
